# The-MVC6-Weekend-Project
~~Just a quick MVC 6 project put together with the help of Microsoft's tutorials and the help of the internet! Will update regularly!~~
// Soon this project will be renamed "The Dashboard Project", simply because....it's what I'm going for!
// The purpose of this project [now] is to be a template that can be used to help [at least] bring out any creative ideas to build from this skeleton of a project into whatever your mind creates!
// The further along I get with this project, I will construct more helpful documentation to help explain everything further. I know it's backwards, but hey, free template to who needs a push for a dashboard site! ;)
// I will continue to push commits to this project weekly every Friday around 5pm to show that I am actively working on this project!
